# Fusion OS

An open-source, AI-powered healthcare operating system. 

Fusion enables next-generation applications to run in real clinical settings. It provides an EHR with plugins that can be added or removed as needed.

It also offers a secure way to run proprietary apps and AI models without the need for data sharing and without exposing intellectual property.

### Implementation

Fusion is a layer that's powered by headless EHR systems (such as [Medplum](https://www.medplum.com)) or any compatible [FHIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Healthcare_Interoperability_Resources) API (such as [HealthLake](https://aws.amazon.com/healthlake)). 

It provides an [open platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_platform) that can run open-source modules [on-prem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-premises_software) and closed-source modules within [confidential computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidential_computing) environments of major cloud providers.

In addition to providing an app store, the Fusion platform will offer pre-built integrations, including:

- AWS ([Transcribe](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/medical), [Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical), [Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract), [Kendra](https://aws.amazon.com/kendra)) to enable healthcare professionals to leverage AI functionalities without the need for extensive configuration or custom development.

### License

Fusion will be available under a permissive software license.

### Getting started

Fusion OS is currently under development.
